# SRCNN
This is my implementation of *super-resolution convolutional neural network* for upscaling raster images.

It implements 3 major steps:
* **Gathering**: loading data (images) and preparing training set;
* **Training**: preparing neural network for usage;
* **Evaluating**: demonstrating results;
